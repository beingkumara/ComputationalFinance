Welcome to the ReadMe page of our application on computational finance! Here, you will find all the information you need to navigate our application and make the most of its features. Whether you're a finance professional or interested in learning more about options and Greek calculations, our application has something for everyone.

* The home page is your starting point, where you will find all the essential information about options and critical terms such as strike price, spot price, interest rate, volatility, maturity date, and option premium.

* You can explore the options page, including European, American, and digital options. You will also find detailed explanations to help you understand how these options work.

* Head to the Greeks page to delve deeper into option pricing and risk management. Here, you will find comprehensive information about options Greeks, which are essential for effective hedging and risk management strategies.

* The calculator page in your application provides users with practical tools to perform calculations related to options. It contains two calculators: one for pricing European options and another for calculating option Greeks. Here's a breakdown of each calculator:
    * **European Option Pricing Calculator**: This calculator allows users to determine the theoretical price of a European call and put options using various pricing models such as the Black-Scholes model, the Binomial tree model, and the Monte Carlo simulation. Users input the required parameters, such as the underlying asset's price, strike price, time to expiration, risk-free interest rate, and volatility. The calculator then uses the selected pricing model to estimate the cost of the option.
    * **Option Greeks Calculator**: This calculator helps users calculate the option Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho) for a given option. Users input the relevant parameters, including the underlying asset's price, strike price, time to expiration, risk-free interest rate, and volatility. The calculator then computes and displays the values of the option Greeks, providing insights into the option's sensitivity to different factors.
